\section{Development tools}

\subsection{Docker} 

Docker~\footnote{\url{https://www.docker.com}} is an open source software platform to create, deploy and manage virtualized application containers on a common operating system. Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel (like cgroups and namespaces), to allow containers to run within a single instance of Linux, avoiding the overload of starting and maintaining virtual machines. We will use a docker to ensure that the experiment carried out can be reproduced in a simple way and obtain the same results.

\subsection{Anaconda}

Anaconda~\footnote{\url{https://www.anaconda.com/}} is a free and open distribution of Python and R languages, used in data science, machine learning and Big Data. We use this tool to manage the Python interpreter for the scripts that automate the tasks of the experiment inside a Docker container. In addition, it allows us to use Jupyter Notebook, an interactive tool for the browser that allows us to work easily with the data from the experiments.
